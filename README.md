# Exif Reader
## Overview
**Exchangeable image file format**, Exif, is a standard that specifies the formats for images, sound, and ancillary tags used by digital cameras (including smartphones), scanners and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras. The specification uses the following existing file formats with the addition of specific metadata tags: JPEG for compressed image files, TIFF for uncompressed image files, and RIFF WAV for audio files.It is not used in JPEG 2000 or GIF.
The metadata tags defined in the Exif standard cover a broad spectrum:
 - Date and time information. Digital cameras will record the current date and time and save this in the metadata
 - Camera settings. This includes static information such as the camera model and make, and information that varies with each image such as orientation (rotation), aperture, shutter speed, focal length, metering mode, and ISO speed information
 - A thumbnail for previewing the picture on the camera's LCD screen, in file managers, or in photo manipulation software.
 - Each unpopulated location that becomes populated if it has exactly **three** populated neighbors
